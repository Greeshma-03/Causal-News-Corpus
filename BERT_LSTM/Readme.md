## LSTM Bert

- Here the bert embeddings are used to train the LSTM Model
- Layers are added for the experimentation with accuracy
- Models are compared with performence and accuracy


## Running Code
- Datasets shoudl be included for it to run and change manually which data sets you want to train and test it on
```python coderun.py```
